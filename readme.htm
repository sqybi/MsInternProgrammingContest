<h1>Marble^4</h1>

<h2>Game description</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><strong>Marble^4</strong> is an HTML5 game with Node.js server. It seems like one of the earliest arcade video games <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong"><em>Pong</em></a> which is designed by Atari Inc. in 1972. However, this is the 4-player version of the <em>Pong</em> game. <br />

<h3>Basic rules</h3>

<p>In this game, everyone has 3 lives, and has a board on one side of the square game area, like this picture: <br />

When the marble reaches one's border and this player doesn't catch the marble with his board, he will lose one life. <br />

As someone lose all his lives, he will be dead and cannot control his board any more. <br />

<li>When you just finished a game, you could refresh your browser to rejoin the server. There is no need to restart server.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to build a server</h2>

<h3>Set your IP address</h3>

<p>You should modify the first line of client.js: <br />
<code>var serverURL         = 'http://localhost';   // URL of server</code> <br />
Set your IP address here instead of "localhost". Port is not necessary.</p>

<h3>Run the server</h3>

<p>Use <code>start_server.bat</code> to run the server.</p>

<h3>Run a client</h3>

<p>Just visit the IP address of the server with port 8080!  </p>
