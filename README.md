# How to run a server

## Set your IP address

You should modify the first line of client.js:

> `var serverURL         = 'http://localhost';   // URL of server`

Set your IP address here instead of "localhost". Port is not necessary.

## Run the server

Use `start_server.bat` to run the server.

# How to run a client

Just visit the IP address of the server with port 8080!
